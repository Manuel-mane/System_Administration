# Windows Server 2019

In this folder, I showcase part of my home lab built by installing Windows Server 2019 and the different features and roles needed to work with AD DS.

You can find the whole documentation [here](https://github.com/Manuel-mane/System_Administration/blob/main/Windows%20Server%202019/1.Installing_Windows_Server_2019.docx)

Results from this project:
* Install Windows Server 2019, with Features and Roles
* Install and Configure Windows Server Core
* Configure a Windows Server Core Domain Controller and Active Directory Domain
* Explore Windows Admin Center and RSAT

The powershell commands used can be found in the repo as well.

### Pre-requirements to complete this project:
- Get a hypervisor (I used Hyper-V)
- Locate a Windows Server  2019 media
- Build a Windows 10 Enterprise instance
- Create a 192.168.3.0/24 NAT network
